abstract = {In this paper we present WristFlex, an always-available on-body gestural interface. Using an array of force sensitive resistors (FSRs) worn around the wrist, the interface can distinguish subtle finger pinch gestures with high accuracy (>80 \%) and speed. The system is trained to classify gestures from subtle tendon movements on the wrist. We demonstrate that WristFlex is a complete system that works wirelessly in real-time. The system is simple and light-weight in terms of power consumption and computational overhead. WristFlex's sensor power consumption is 60.7 uW, allowing the prototype to potentially last more then a week on a small lithium polymer battery. Also, WristFlex is small and non-obtrusive, and can be integrated into a wristwatch or a bracelet. We perform user studies to evaluate the accuracy, speed, and repeatability. We demonstrate that the number of gestures can be extended with orientation data from an accelerometer. We conclude by showing example applications.},

abstract = {We present FibeRobo, a thermally-actuated liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) fiber that can be embedded or structured into textiles and enable silent and responsive interactions with shape-changing, fiber-based interfaces. Three definitive properties distinguish FibeRobo from other actuating threads explored in HCI. First, they exhibit rapid thermal self-reversing actuation with large displacements (∼40\%) without twisting. Second, we present a reproducible UV fiber drawing setup that produces hundreds of meters of fiber with a sub-millimeter diameter. Third, FibeRobo is fully compatible with existing textile manufacturing machinery such as weaving looms, embroidery, and industrial knitting machines. This paper contributes to developing temperature-responsive LCE fibers, a facile and scalable fabrication pipeline with optional heating element integration for digital control, mechanical characterization, and the establishment of higher hierarchical textile structures and design space. Finally, we introduce a set of demonstrations that illustrate the design space FibeRobo enables.},

	abstract = {Textile interfaces are of interest to ubiquitous computing as they are easy to carry and manipulate. However, interesting questions remain about what type of natural gestures people make when interacting with textile interfaces and their emotional response to this interaction. We introduce GesFabri, a set of five interactive textile interfaces with distinct textures, created to investigate the intuitive interaction gestures and accompanied the emotional experience. This research sought to (1) design textile interfaces with intuitive gesture affordance, (2) explore the emotional effects of the developed gesture-based interfaces under four feedback modes (touch-only, visual feedback, audio feedback, multisensory feedback). The experimental results verify our hypotheses that (1) textile texture could provide natural gesture affordances; (2) the GesFabri interfaces' feedback mode was the main factor in the differences of emotional valence, arousal, GSR; and (3) both gesture-based interaction on textiles and the feedback mode had an impact on user emotions. These results highlight the gesture affordances of the e-textile interfaces and contribute to a better understanding of the user experience when interacting with gesture-based textile interfaces.},

	abstract = {In Internet of Things (IoT) era, electronic textiles (E-textiles), which combine various functional devices on a fabric, have attracted attention. Among various components for E-textiles, the human-machine interface device, for example, a keyboard, is one of the most important parts. The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) can be a powerful sensing component for the interface device due to its cost-eﬀectiveness, design ﬂexibility and selfpowered operation. Previous studies reported fabric-based sensor devices with TENG, but as yet, no device that harnesses commercial compatibility with the textile industry has been reported. It is timely to explore a low-cost TENG-based keyboard made completely of commercial fabric for early commercialization. This paper proposes a TENG-based wearable keyboard that uses only cheap commercial fabrics. Each cell in the proposed keyboard generates electrical signals according to an external touch without any power supply. After an appropriate ﬁltering process, the proposed keyboard can detect a key stroke without any ambiguity. We verify the keyboard operation by typing a word and playing music. The material dependency of the proposed keyboard is experimentally validated with various material pairs. Finally, the endurance of the proposed keyboard against folding, repeated touches and washing is experimentally conﬁrmed for actual applications in a real environment.},
